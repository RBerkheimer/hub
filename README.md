# hub

Hub is a small core-async (pubsub) based broadcasting processing system.
Feed messages through the https service and hub will route them to where
they are supposed to go.
Hub routes all messages through a centralized log that can be replayed.
Hub provides a sane way for system growth by using a tiered publication/subscription strategy.
Message patterns follow the well established Kafka style messaging.
